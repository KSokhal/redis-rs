# redis-rs

This is a learning project that implements a basic in-memory Redis server in Rust. It supports the RESP protocol and a small subset of Redis commands.

Note: This project is not for production use. It is still a work in progress and may have bugs, errors, or missing features. Use it at your own risk.

### Todo

-   [ ] Add data persistence, both AOF and RDB
-   [ ] Add more commands
